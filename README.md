# ReactJS Demo

On this demo page I used the reactjs on client-side and I used PHP server-side, the PHP backend uses a DEP framework 
 with Database connection to explore the capability of reactjs fetching data from backend and display it on the page.

I use ChartJs and control it with button created as react component, the click event trigger the updating method 
to randomize the bart chart on the page.

I also used the RequireJS to include react and react-dom javascript files, this is to make sure that reactjs can  be
integrated to our existing system that uses the same setup.
